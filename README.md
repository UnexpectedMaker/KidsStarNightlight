# KidsStarNightlight
Kids RGB LED Star Nightlight project based on my video here....
https://youtu.be/u-KtG9Ui_h8

Inlcluded in this reposity:
- STL file for the 3D printed star
- Arduino C code to control the RGB LEDs

This project uses my TinyDev Tiny85 board specifically designed for projects like this that is available on tindie here....
https://www.tindie.com/products/13443/

But it will work with any other micro-controller board that has 2 free GPIOs.

Enjoy!

# Buy me a coffee?
I love making and designing projects but sharing open source projects takes a lot of thought and time. I do it because I think itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community like many have done before me.

If you find this project useful or want to see more open source projects like it, please consider a donation to say thanks!
